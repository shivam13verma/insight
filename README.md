# insight

This is the solution to the problem set: https://github.com/InsightDataScience/digital-wallet.

Run as follows:
- Clone repo locally
- For unit tests, `cd insight_testsuite` `bash run_tests.sh`. Should see 3 tests passed.
- The folder `paymo_input` consists of the first 1000 batch and stream inputs. This can be used as a test, or the files replaced with the originals.
- Run code using `bash run.sh` from repo directory.
